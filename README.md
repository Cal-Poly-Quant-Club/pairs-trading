# Project Description
Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Pairs Trading Strategy

# Project Work
Project work will be compiled in a GitHub (if code), linked here, and in this google drive folder.

# Project Members:
Billy Block

Charlie Ray

# Overview
This project aims to critically evaluate the effectiveness of the Pairs Trading strategy within the realm of quantitative finance. Through the application of statistical tests and the use of correlation matrices to spot potential arbitrage opportunities, students will address the research question: "What, if any, are the benefits of the Pairs Trading strategy?" The final product will be a comprehensive PDF report outlining the findings. If desired, students may collaborate with a CS team member to integrate the strategy into an HFT system.

# Objectives
Apply multiple statistical tests (Correlation Matrix, and Sortino ratio, among others) to assess the Pairs Trading strategy's effectiveness.

Construct correlation matrices to identify possible arbitrage opportunities.

Backtest the Pairs Trading strategy using the "cpquant" library.

Write a comprehensive report addressing the research question.

Optional: Work with a CS team member to integrate the Pairs Trading strategy into an HFT system.

# Deliverables
A comprehensive PDF report that outlines the evaluation of the Pairs Trading strategy, addressing the research question.

Optional: An HFT system with an integrated Pairs Trading strategy.

# Methodology
Students should start with a solid understanding of the Pairs Trading strategy and the different statistical tests required. Correlation matrices can be constructed to identify potential pairs for trading, followed by the application of the statistical tests. The "cpquant" library should be used for backtesting the strategy. All findings should be reported in a well-structured, comprehensive report. If desired, a collaboration with a CS team member can occur to integrate the strategy into an HFT system.

# Timeline
Weeks 1-2: Understand the Pairs Trading strategy and relevant statistical tests.

Weeks 3-4: Construct correlation matrices and identify potential pairs.

Weeks 5-6: Apply statistical tests and backtest the strategy using "cpquant."

Weeks 7-8: Compile the findings into a comprehensive report.

Optional: Weeks 9-10: Collaborate with a CS team member to integrate the strategy into an HFT system.

# Roles and Responsibilities
Roles can be divided among the team members, such as Research Analysts (understanding strategies and tests), Data Analysts (running tests and backtesting), and Report Writers. If opted for, there could also be a Collaborator role for working with a CS team member.

# Evaluation Criteria
You should evaluate this project based on

The depth and accuracy of the statistical tests.

The clarity and comprehensiveness of the report.

The relevance of the arbitrage opportunities identified.

Optional: The successful integration of the Pairs Trading strategy into an HFT system.

# Communication and Collaboration
Regular meetings to discuss progress, address issues, and share insights should be scheduled. If opted for, regular communication with the CS team member is also crucial.

# Creativity and Learning
While the primary objectives are defined, students are encouraged to bring in their unique insights and innovative approaches to the project. The ultimate goal is to gain experience evaluating statistical models in relation to quantitative finance. Although this particular research question has been asked (and answered) before, attempting to evaluate it on your own will give you the experience needed to research harder questions.

# Additional Notes
In order to complete this project, you will need to be able to code. Your code does not need to be perfect and can overall be quite “bad” because it only needs to run once to get you the statistical information you need. However, you will still need to collaborate with partners and thus will need to use GitHub. You could either just use standard python .py files, or leverage the benefits of jupyter notebooks, both will work. One is better but not taught in introductory CS classes. Familiarize yourself with GitHub & pandas, as that is how you will be doing most of your work.
